## Stable IDs

Setting stable IDs is crucial if your app is used in combination with certain functions.

Most controls in the template apps \(except for aggregations that are created dynamically, such as list items\) are assigned a stable ID to identify the controls in integration tests, extensibility tools like key user adaptation, as well as interactive inline help tools.
