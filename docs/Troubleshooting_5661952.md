In this tutorial, we will show you some tools that will help you if you run into problems with your OpenUI5 app.

We will introduce you to the browser developer tools and show you the various tools that OpenUI5 offers.

For example, the OpenUI5 tools can help you with the following tasks:

-   Inspect and debug apps

-   Examine bugs and analyze errors

-   Simulate UI changes

-   Find out how to improve performance


To help you practice using the tools, we created an app with errors that we will use throughout the tutorial. You can view and download the app in the Demo Kitat [Troubleshooting](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting.01/preview).
