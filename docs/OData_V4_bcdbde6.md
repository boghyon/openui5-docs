## OData V4

In this tutorial, we explore how features of OData V4 can be used in OpenUI5. We write a small app that consumes data from an OData V4 service to understand how to access, modify, aggregate, and filter data in an OData V4 model.

OData is a standard protocol for creating and consuming data by using simple HTTP and REST APIs for create, read, update, delete \(CRUD\) operations.

We start with an initial app that simply retrieves data from an OData V4 service and displays it as a plain list.

> You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can jump directly to any step you want. In each step, download the code from the previous step, copy it to your workspace, and make sure that the application runs by calling the `webapp/index.html` file.
