### Project Setup

Before you start developing apps with OpenUI5, you start by setting up the development environment of your choice. You can find our recommendations under [Development Environment](Development_Environment_7bb04e0.md).

After that, you define the project setup. If you work in a team, we recommend using a continuous integration setup as described under [Continuous Integration: Ensure Code Quality](Continuous_Integration_Ensure_Code_Quality__fe7a158.md). If you work alone, you should at the very least set up an automated testing environment.

### Development

When faced with developing an app, you have several ways to get started ranging from app templates or a make-em-completely-from-scratch approach. But which approach is right for your situation? In most cases, it's your level of expertise or need for flexibility and freedom that will decide.

Think of the app templates described in this section as a kind of best practice for app development. They incorporate our latest recommendations and can be used as a starting point for developing apps according to the SAP Fiori design guidelines. They include generic application functionality and tests that can be easily extended with custom functionality if needed. There are separate templates for Worklist and Master-Detail application patterns, and we have an empty basic template. The templates are described under [App Templates: Kick Start Your App Development](App_Templates_Kick_Start_Your_App_Development_a460a73.md).

If you're skilled at coding and want the freedom and flexibility, you can build an app completely from scratch. In the chapters in this section, you will find some guidance on how to deal with crucial concepts such as accessibility, security, device adaptation.

Be sure to check out information about things that you really should avoid doing while coding: [Coding Issues to Avoid](Coding_Issues_to_Avoid_3877872.md).

### Packaging and Deployment

How you deploy your app when you're finished depends on the tools you use and the platform where your app is going to run. See the related documentation for details.

For example, it's quite easy to deploy an app to SAP Cloud Platform with SAP Web IDE. For more information about SAP Web IDE, see the documentation for SAP Web IDE on the SAP Help Portal at [https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP\_Web\_IDE](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_Web_IDE).
