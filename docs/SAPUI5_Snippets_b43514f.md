## SAPUI5 Snippets

SAPUI5 snippets are templates and examples on how to use the SAPUI5 runtime and controls.

***

You can add SAPUI5-specific code parts, so called SAPUI5snippets. SAPUI5 snippets are available as prepared HTML pages with no separation between model, view and, controller \(MVC\). They are generated during startup of the Eclipse runtime.

1.  To open the *Snippets* view, proceed as follows:

    1.  Choose *Window* \> *Show View* \> *Other...*.

    2.  In the **Show View** dialog, choose *General* \> *Snippets*, and confirm you selection with *Open*.

    The *Snippet* view opens.
