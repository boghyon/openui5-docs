## App Templates: Kick Start Your App Development

The app templates documented here are a kind of "best practice" for your app development.

They incorporate our latest recommendations and can be used for example as a starting point for developing apps. They include generic application functionality and tests that can be easily extended with custom functionality if needed.

There are separate templates for the **Worklist** and **Master-Detail** application patterns, which are closely aligned with the SAP Fiori design guidelines. The subsections of this chapter explain the concepts and features of each of these templates. See the  [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/).

> Note:
> These templates were primarily created for developing SAP Fiori apps in accordance with the SAP Fiori design guidelines, but can also be used in any other OpenUI5 context.
> 
> 

The basic template serves as a starting point when you want to start from scratch, but also want to make sure that everything is set up properly.
