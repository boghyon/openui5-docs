## Structuring: Components and Descriptor

OpenUI5 provides faceless components for services that deliver data from the back end system, and UI components that extend components and add rendering functionality. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library.
