## Accessibility Aspects

If you are developing OpenUI5 controls, you have to be aware of the accessibility aspects. A deeper understanding is needed, so that all accessibility requirements are met.

In the following topics, we provide additional information for control developers on keyboard handling, high-contrast theming and other important accessibility aspects.

For information on colors and theming, follow the guidelines listed under *Related Information*.
