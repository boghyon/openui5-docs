## Variant for Bootstrapping from Content Delivery Network

OpenUI5 can either be loaded locally with a relative path from an SAP Web server or externally from a Content Delivery Network \(CDN\).

> Note:
> Loading OpenUI5 from a CDN improves your app performance: You can load from a server that \(in most cases\) is much closer to your location, and you can benefit from the caching mechanism and the language fallback logic.
> 
> 

To access your OpenUI5 libraries from a Content Delivery Network \(CDN\) instead of your local MIME respository, you need to configure the CDN as an external location in the Customizing of your backend system.

For more information, see the documentation for the Customizing activity *Configure SAPUI5 Bootstrapping* in Customizing under *SAP NetWeaver* \> *UI Technologies* \> *SAPUI5*.
