## Accessibility

In this guide we cover the most important accessibility aspects for application development, based on OpenUI5.

As an application developer, you need to be aware of accessibility in every step of the process. OpenUI5 controls have built-in accessibility features, but you need to take care when building and combining them into an application. Even though features like keyboard handling come out of the box, you need to pay attention to proper focus handling, so that all parts of the app are reachable with key commands. The following chapters showcase different aspects and offer tips how to test your app.
