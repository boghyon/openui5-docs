## Screen Reader Support for OpenUI5 Controls

OpenUI5 offers screen reader support in order to aid people with visual impairments. The implementation is based on the ARIA \(Accessible Rich Internet Applications\) standard.

***

### General Information

Currently, the following libraries have screen reader support based on the ARIA standard:

-   sap.f

-   sap.m

-   sap.tnt

-   sap.ui.commons

-   sap.ui.core

-   sap.ui.generic

-   sap.ui.layout

-   sap.ui.suite

-   sap.ui.table

-   sap.ui.unified

-   sap.ui.ux3

-   sap.uxap


OpenUI5 controls provide the prerequisites for screen reader support based on the ARIA standard. All screen readers that implement this standard should work fine. If there are deviations in the interpretation, these need to be addressed to the screen reader vendor. If you need more information on our testing environment, see SAP Note [2564165](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2564165).

> Note:
> -   No screen reader activation settings are necessary since the accessibility mode in OpenUI5 is switched on by default.
