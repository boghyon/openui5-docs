## Control-Specific Behavior

Screen readers need to handle OpenUI5 controls with similar functionality in a similar way. Still there are differences, and application developers need to know them, in order to use the correct control for the desired task.

The first thing that should be read upon entry for any control has to be its ARIA role. What is read afterwards for each control is different, but similar types of controls will read similar elements.
