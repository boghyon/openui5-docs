## Keyboard Handling for One-Dimensional Navigation

The following keys and key combinations are used for navigation in one-dimensional item containers \(for example, lists and drop-downs\).

 > **Warning:** The below table contains complex elements that cannot not be displayed within a simple markdown table. It has been automatically converted to an HTML table. It's design may vary from the source page!

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Key combination</th>
			<th>Behavior</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>*UP*, *LEFT*</td>
			<td>If focus is on an item, move focus to the **previous** item. If focus is on the first item, do nothing.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>*DOWN*, *RIGHT*</td>
			<td>If focus is on an item, move focus to the **next** item. If focus is on the last item, do nothing.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>*PAGE UP*</td>
			<td> If focus is on an item, move focus **up/ left** by page size.
 > Note:
 > Page size can be set by the application; default page size is 10 items

 If focus is on the last item, do nothing.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>*PAGE DOWN*</td>
			<td> If focus is on an item, move focus **down/ right** by page size.
