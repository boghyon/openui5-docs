## Views

The view in the Model View Controller concept is responsible for defining and rendering the UI. OpenUI5 supports predefined view types.

The following predefined view types are available:

-   **XML view** \(file or string in XML format\); the **XMLView** type supports a mix of XML and plain HTML.

-   **JSON view** \(file or string in JSON format\)

-   **JS view**, constructed in a traditional manner

-   **HTML view** \(file or string in HTML format\)


> Note:
> We recommend to use XML views, because XML views force a clear separation of the UI definition from the application logic \(which has to be implemented in the controller\). This makes the code is better readable and easier to support.
> 
> Therefore, we concentrate on XML views and only provide examples for XML views throughout this documentation.
